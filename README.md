# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

This is my take on the arcade game clone project from Udacity. The main goal was to build a frogger-like game with JavaScript.
I didnÂ´t customize the game in any special ways because I got a tight schedule, but will probably work on that later and experiment with
my code a little bit.

For now you can control the little boy with the arrow keys and should try to navigate him around the bad bugs until he reaches the water.
If that happens you win the Game, an alert will pop up and the little boy is back on his starting position. If you collide with a bug
he will also be resetted to his starting position.
